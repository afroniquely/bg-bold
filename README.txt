INSTALL
1. Upload the BG Bold theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.)
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the BG Bold theme.
4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.

FONTS
To replicate the typography, you need to create a kit over at https://typekit.com/fonts. Font weights and styles used:
1. Proxima Nova - Regular, Bold
2. Futura PT - Book, Medium, Heavy

FRONT PAGE
To replicate what I have currently on my front page, create a page, set it as the static front page and use the HTML found at http://pastebin.com/35e4NRp9 as a place to start.
